certificate.

## File Description
* ``Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb`` : Customer Segmentation Report: used unsupervised learning method: K-Means to 
create customer segments. 
* ``Arvato Project - Supervised Learning``: Built multiple machine learning models to predict whether or not an 
individual will respond to a campaign.
* ``Arvato Project - Predictions``: Made predictions using the best model and submitted the results to Kaggle.
* ``utils.py``: Helper functions used in the three notebooks.
